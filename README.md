# KMeans-Clustering

K-Means Clustering model implemented in python. 


The class is imported from sklearn.cluster library. 

To find the optimal number of cluster for the dataset, the model was provided with different numbers of cluster ranging from 1 to 10. 


The WCSS ( or Within Cluster Sum of Squares ) was caluated and plotted to find the optimal number of clusters. 


The "Elbow Method" was used to find the optimal number of clusters. 


Finally, the clusters were visualised using scatter plot.
